# Web Scraping in Node Example

> By no means is this a perfect example. But it is a good starting point. Use this at your own risk, not all sites like to be scraped.

## Installing Node

In order to use this program you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/). Node.js also comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) included, which is the package manager for Node.js. All commands below will be done from the terminal.

## Preparing the project

Both the simple and advanced example use the `products.json` file as their source of truth for what they will be searching [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) for. [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
